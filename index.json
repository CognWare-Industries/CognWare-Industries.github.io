[00:01:50] A potential problem arises when one becomes \u0026ldquo;too smart\u0026rdquo; or finds everything too easy, leading to boredom and creative plateaus. This happens when the \u0026ldquo;average world\u0026rdquo; no longer presents sufficient challenges. [00:02:20] The proposed solution is to learn to create your own games or introduce self-imposed constraints when effortless situations become boring. Overcoming Creative Plateaus: Strategies # [00:03:45] To shake off creative rust, two initial steps are suggested: [00:04:15] Be rigorous with your current tasks, looking for hidden complexities or missed observations. [00:04:35] Engage in metacognition – thinking about why you are thinking in a certain way – to clarify context. [00:05:15] The core strategy when boredom sets in is to start introducing random, interesting constraints. Examples of Introducing Constraints # The speaker provides personal examples of how he introduces constraints to spark creativity:\n[00:05:40] Basic fabrication and DIY projects using readily available materials (stationery, discarded items like dog leashes). [00:06:40] Modeling energy concepts (elastic potential energy) using common sources like springs from ballpoint pens or different types of rubber bands. [00:07:35] Building structures (e.g., tetrahedrons) using unexpected materials like new pencils and erasers for joints. [00:08:45] Using tools like a kitchen scale to test the structural integrity of these improvised creations. [00:09:45] Engineering systems like pendulums and introducing \u0026ldquo;organized randomness\u0026rdquo; (e.g., secondary pendulums) or computationally simulating them with resource constraints. [00:15:05] Cloud watching with specific, defined objectives (constraints). [00:16:10] Examples include looking only for animal shapes, specific letters/numbers, collinear clouds, or trying to predict the weather for the next few hours based solely on observation. Defining a task sharpens focus and makes observation a creative problem-solving exercise. Constraints vs. Freedom # [00:10:50] The feeling of creativity often comes from the idea of constraints. [00:11:00] While we often chase various forms of freedom (temporal, financial, intellectual), we actively avoid constraints. [00:11:50] The speaker finds that engineering interesting constraints or reframing existing ones makes problems more incentivizing and induces creativity more effectively than having complete freedom. Redefining Relaxation # [00:13:35] The speaker contrasts the conventional view of relaxation (doing less) with his own: true relaxation comes from doing something without focusing on the results, incentives, or perceived worth of the action. Conclusion: Embrace Constraints # [00:17:00] The main point is that constraints are not inherently bad and can be powerful tools for creativity. [00:17:15] When bored, instead of seeking more freedom, try engineering your own constraints or making the problem harder. [00:17:40] This constrained thinking surprisingly leads to more interesting solutions and insights that can be applied to other problems. [00:18:00] The speaker mentions his other platform, thebitmaze.com, for philosophical discussions on computer science.

concept of overthinking, not just as a problem to be managed, but as a cognitive trait that can be \u0026ldquo;weaponized\u0026rdquo; or reframed to create value. The speaker aims to turn a perceived negative into a useful tool for personal and cognitive development.\nThe video discusses two complementary approaches: dealing with overthinking through acceptance and tooling, and actively weaponizing it by integrating it into one\u0026rsquo;s processes and creative pursuits.\nUnderstanding and Dealing with Overthinking # [00:01:35] Overthinking is defined as thinking that feels out of control, where one cannot stop when desired. [00:02:05] It often stems from repeating the same thoughts or questions that lack immediate answers. [00:02:50] The first mindset shift is to be okay with not having instant answers. Understanding that comprehension and solutions take time is crucial. [00:04:58] Introduce the concept of a \u0026ldquo;thunk\u0026rdquo; (inspired by computer science) - delegating thoughts and their processing to a later time. [00:06:00] This involves capturing thoughts/questions (as \u0026ldquo;thunks\u0026rdquo;) in a system, like a GTD (Getting Things Done) workflow file. [00:07:15] Batch process these thunks regularly (e.g., weekly). The speaker finds many resolve themselves over time. [00:08:00] Be comfortable with making black-box assumptions in the moment instead of trying to understand everything immediately. [00:08:38] Documenting unsuccessful thought processes or why an answer wasn\u0026rsquo;t reached is vital to avoid thinking in circles. This highlights the importance of logging and journaling for self-analysis. Weaponizing Overthinking # [00:11:10] Shift from seeing overthinking as negative to actively enjoying and utilizing free-flowing thought. [00:11:45] Reframe thinking as a main pursuit for dedicated time slots (like creating unscripted video essays). [00:14:00] Trust your brain\u0026rsquo;s natural processing capability when you get out of its way and don\u0026rsquo;t force specific outcomes. [00:14:55] Engage in cognitive work: Read varied and challenging material that questions your existing thoughts and knowledge. Defending your thoughts against challenging ideas helps refine them; being proven wrong leads to cognitive upgrades. [00:17:00] Analyze and dissect your thoughts: Use writing for hindsight analysis (which is often stronger than real-time understanding). Employ structured logging, indexing, and data structures (like knowledge graphs) for personal cognition to better search and understand your thought history. [00:18:30] Leverage public creation (like video essays) to introduce pressure that forces better articulation and cognitive improvement. This requires balancing the desire for improvement with avoiding debilitating perfectionism. [00:20:10] Embrace the adage \u0026ldquo;Know Thyself\u0026rdquo; and apply analytical, mathematical, and computational tools intrinsically to understand your own mind. Reframing Weaknesses # [00:22:00] The video highlights that traits framed as negative, like overthinking or self-doubt, can be weaponized. Weaknesses often represent areas of high potential growth (\u0026ldquo;highest cognitive slope\u0026rdquo;) where effort can lead to significant improvements and help balance one\u0026rsquo;s overall capabilities. Weaponizing cognitive debts is presented as a \u0026ldquo;flip\u0026rdquo; or a momentary shift in perspective and approach. Conclusion # [00:24:40] The two modes discussed are the Wise and Ambitious approach (dealing with overthinking through acceptance supported by tooling) and the Ambitious and Wise approach (using tooling to enable ambitious cognitive exploration and creation). Both modes involve reframing perceived weaknesses and applying structure, analysis, and dedicated effort to cognitive processes to turn them into valuable assets. [00:25:55] The underlying message is to understand and utilize your cognitive traits effectively, turning potential downsides into tools for growth and creation.

The speaker discusses the thought process behind creating a transferable toolkit for understanding and diagnosing various abstract problems, independent of specific domain objectives.\nThe Need for General Analysis # [00:00:45] The speaker introduces general analysis as a generic, diagnostic toolkit applicable to many abstractions.\n[00:02:00] Analysis should facilitate critical thought and provide directives for exploring potential solutions by symbolically analyzing concepts.\nFraming the Analysis: Foundations # [00:02:50] A key starting point is defining a domain-specific language (DSL) and choosing appropriate axioms or fundamental units for the problem. [00:03:30] Selecting a sensible level of granularity or the \u0026ldquo;basement level\u0026rdquo; of abstraction is crucial. Being aware of your own context-based axioms is helpful. [00:04:10] Building upon this foundation involves laying generic foundations for analysis. Dimensions and State Analysis # [00:04:50] The framework involves identifying orthogonal axes or dimensions of analysis. [00:05:10] Across variations of these dimensions, one analyzes the context or state of the problem. [00:05:58] Example dimension: Time (analyzing context in past, present, future predictions; can be continuous or discrete milestones). [00:06:20] Example dimension: Scale or Size (how context varies with scale; defining parameters for scale involves parameter engineering). [00:07:10] Dimensions can involve discrete categories or continuous variations. [00:08:10] Engineering proper units or indicators is referred to as parameter engineering or representation learning. Abstract Spaces and Combining Dimensions # [00:09:15] Analysis can focus on individual dimensions or combinations (e.g., how scale changes over time). [00:10:05] The state or context can be modeled as a function of input parameters (a tuple combining metrics from axes), existing in an abstract space rather than a simple geometric one. [00:11:30] The state should ideally be represented flexibly, not bound to simple scalar or vector fields for general analysis. [00:12:00] The speaker proposes the term semiotensoric space to describe a combination of symbols (categorical) and tensors (numerical/vectoric) for representing both inputs (axes) and outputs (state). [00:12:30] The analysis itself can be viewed as transformations between semiotensoric spaces, mapping input dimensions to the resulting state representation. Applying Calculus and Gradients # [00:13:00] Within this abstract framework, calculus concepts like partial derivatives or gradients can potentially be applied to analyze rates of change of the state with respect to specific dimensions (particularly the tensoric parts). [00:14:00] While standard gradients (nabla) on the entire semiotensoric state might not be feasible, partial optimization of specific components is conceivable. Conclusion: The Generic Analyzer # [00:15:00] The overarching idea is to develop a generic analysis framework that can be applied to any domain without starting from scratch. [00:15:15] Such a framework could auto-generate a DSL, analyze problems in the semiotensoric space, and produce reports.

[01:10] Being aware of unknown unknowns is a powerful cognitive tool for better planning, timelines, risk assessment, and structuring efforts, recognizing that not everything can be fully modeled or predicted. Strategies for Dealing with Uncertainty # [01:58] Preparation and Contingency: While impossible to have a plan for everything (like Batman), having generic contingency plans and reactions is useful. [03:00] Categorization and Triage: Triage potential issues into categories and engineer generic responses based on these classifications (like handling different hurricane categories). [04:10] Exploration and Sidecar Projects: Dedicate time to exploration or have sidecar projects that are exploratory in nature within your domain. This includes browsing new research, reading, and identifying potential novel impacts on your current work. [06:20] Understanding uncertainty and unknown unknowns encourages a more peaceful life and helps handle unexpected setbacks or being \u0026ldquo;derailed\u0026rdquo; better. [07:05] While the future can\u0026rsquo;t be predicted precisely, you can understand its generic probabilistic distribution and focus on picking up the signal rather than the noise. Building Cognitive Infrastructure # [08:30] Naming Abstractions: Create a language or terminology around unknown unknowns to help categorize them and develop frameworks for dealing with them in the moment. [09:50] Engineering Your Psyche: Develop a generic, extractable cognitive infrastructure – a flexible set of tools and tactics applicable in various situations. The Power of Stories and Shared Context # [10:40] Using Analogies from Fiction: Leverage fictional universes (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings), video games, or stories (movies, books) to create analogies and categorize unknown unknowns when they arise. [18:00] Stories serve as a super dense encoding for conveying strategies, states of mind, and context quickly and enjoyably to others. [21:55] Shared Story Consumption: If working in a team or organization, sharing common stories creates a mutual language or symbolic index for rapid communication and synchronization of strategies when encountering new issues. [24:30] Music and other cultural elements (concerts, movies) also act as forms of dense encoding, helping to align or synchronize collective human minds towards ideas or moods. [28:00] This shared context allows you to trigger specific associations or strategies in others rapidly, effectively orchestrating the \u0026ldquo;global cognitive infrastructure\u0026rdquo; with simple references. The Final Strategy: Humility and Experience # [30:40] Know Your Limit: Don\u0026rsquo;t overestimate what you can realistically do. Ambitious failures teach humility and the limits of prediction. [32:10] Value Experience: Gain experience and learn intuitively from failures. Some necessary skills for dealing with unknown unknowns are not fully conveyable through theory but are learned through practice and failure. [33:40] Build Better Languages (Jargon): Continue to build and refine your personal language or use jargon to quickly encode and convey complex concepts or experiences.

The speaker argues that true polymathy isn\u0026rsquo;t about having learned many named things, but about applying generic skills and orchestrating resources to achieve objectives.\nUnderstanding Traditional Polymathy vs. Practical Polymathy # [00:00:14] Polymathy is etymologically defined as having learned many things, with variations between a shallow dilettante and a deep contributor. The term holds romantic appeal, but its practical interpretation is often flawed. [00:01:17] Natural exploration in youth leads to early generalism, followed by societal pressure towards specialization. This creates a tension between being a generalist (polymath) and a specialist. [00:02:23] While specialization (being a \u0026ldquo;master of one\u0026rdquo;) is widely promoted, polymathy is often underrepresented or viewed negatively as distraction or dabbling (\u0026ldquo;jack of all, master of none,\u0026rdquo; though the full adage suggests being \u0026ldquo;still better than a master of one\u0026rdquo;). [00:03:31] Polymaths like Da Vinci are often presented in hindsight based on their contributions across domains, focusing on the awe rather than the messy, iterative process. The speaker hypothesizes that their approach was more about fundamental observation and iterative application, less about explicit domain knowledge. [00:07:28] The effort associated with polymathy is often modeled as a prerequisite, which the speaker contests. He hypothesizes that successful polymaths do not care about explicit domain boundaries when working, focusing instead on fundamental aspects like observations, inputs, outputs, and processes. [00:09:00] The speaker redefines practical polymathy not as \u0026ldquo;having learned many things,\u0026rdquo; but as the ability to apply generic processes and abstractions in an applied manner – essentially, applied observation and strategic resource orchestration. The Shift to a Mission-Oriented Mindset # [00:09:45] The \u0026ldquo;many\u0026rdquo; aspect of polymathy is something attributed in hindsight. Instead of a domain-oriented mindset (studying foundations of named domains), a mission-oriented mindset is more effective. This involves studying anything and everything necessary to complete a specific objective. [00:11:00] Practical polymathy is about focusing intensely on the mission, doing whatever it takes. It means not self-discretizing into careers or scopes but understanding the problem, available tools, their interactions, and orchestrating resources strategically towards the mission. [00:11:40] The societal push towards specialization and domain focus is partly driven by the industry\u0026rsquo;s need for fungible (replaceable) talent, which is good for organizational continuity but detrimental to individual uniqueness and value creation beyond a specific function. [00:13:52] The mission-oriented mindset fosters generic orchestration ability, going beyond predefined domains. Domains become useful for naming, optimizing, and organizing knowledge after the fact (in hindsight), not for guiding the initial execution. [00:15:10] This mindset involves understanding the current state, defining the desired state (mission), knowing available tools, their resource consumption, and orchestrating tool calls to move step-by-step towards the desired state (likened to the \u0026ldquo;controller pattern\u0026rdquo; in computer science). Implications for Education # [00:20:31] The traditional education system, which often begins with definition and \u0026ldquo;name-dropping\u0026rdquo; domains (physics, chemistry, etc.), hinders the development of practical polymathic skills. [00:21:55] A better approach, dubbed domain discovery, involves giving students a mission, providing fundamental tools (basal abstractions) without explicit domain names, letting them experiment and orchestrate these tools to achieve the mission, describe their process using fundamental terms, and only then introducing the formal names of the domains they implicitly worked within. This fosters indispensable strategic and observational thinking skills. Conclusion # [00:23:18] Practical polymathy involves separating the process of execution (mission-focused orchestration) from the process of hindsight naming and optimization. The word \u0026ldquo;polymathy\u0026rdquo; itself is seen as more applicable to describing the outcome in hindsight than the active, mission-driven process itself. [00:25:30] The channel\u0026rsquo;s mission includes redefining societal systems like education by promoting these ideas of fundamental tooling, mission-oriented learning, and domain discovery. The speaker concludes by emphasizing that practical polymathy is about the dynamic process of achieving a mission through generic skills and orchestration, a process that transcends predefined domain boundaries.\n","date":"21 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/saas/polymathy/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003ePractical Polymathy: Beyond Domains and Definitions \n    \u003cdiv id=\"practical-polymathy-beyond-domains-and-definitions\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#practical-polymathy-beyond-domains-and-definitions\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n      \u003ciframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" loading=\"eager\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VCtZGApFA7s?autoplay=0\u0026amp;controls=1\u0026amp;end=0\u0026amp;loop=0\u0026amp;mute=0\u0026amp;start=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"YouTube video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis video explores the concept of polymathy, critiquing the traditional, hindsight-based understanding and proposing a \u0026ldquo;practical\u0026rdquo; approach focused on mission-oriented execution rather than domain-specific learning.

The speaker emphasizes language\u0026rsquo;s role as an interface, particularly the internal language we use to communicate with ourselves, arguing that improving this inner dialogue is fundamental to becoming a better thinker and communicator.\nDefining Language as an Interface and Interpretation # [00:00:00] The video introduces language as an interface, distinct from computing concepts like processing or storage, focusing on conveying information. [00:00:42] Language is defined broadly as any sequence of differentiable signals, including spoken words, sign language, Morse code, tapping patterns, or even blinking lights. [00:01:36] Different forms of communication, like images, offer varying densities and parallelism compared to sequential speech. [00:01:56] The effort required for creation (writing) and interpretation (reading) varies depending on the communication medium (e.g., images can take more creation effort but offer density for interpretation). [00:02:51] The context in which language is evaluated is highlighted as the most crucial aspect of interpretation. Language as a Driver of Innovation and Abstraction # [00:03:29] Language is considered a powerful driver of innovation. [00:03:49] The core argument is that naming abstractions is essential for stabilizing foundational concepts upon which higher abstractions can be built (illustrated with examples like Arabic numerals and the concept of a \u0026ldquo;chair\u0026rdquo;). [00:05:12] Viewers are encouraged to think of language generically as an interface – with oneself, with others, or with groups – rather than limiting it to a specific linguistic system. Engineering Your Inner Language and Context # [00:05:58] Language and context are presented as dynamic, constantly updated processes, especially within a human mind. [00:06:36] A key takeaway is to engineer your own context and consequently your interpretation of language, by building a personal vocabulary around how you interpret the world. [00:07:23] Controlling interpretation involves bridging the gap between the symbolic/semantic (universal concepts) and the continuous/detailed (personal experience). [00:08:07] Language encompasses not just explicit signals but also the full context, including visual cues, presentation, status (e.g., having a beard), and surroundings – everything communicates something, and interpretation is personal. [00:08:59] Important skills involve expanding the scope and ease of interpretation and triaging noise vs. signal in complex information or life situations. Communication With Self: The Most Important Interface # [00:11:32] Language is intrinsically tied to thought; thinking occurs through internal interfaces. [00:12:13] Inventing personal words or phrases for routines or states (\u0026ldquo;morning philosophical protocol\u0026rdquo;) can dense-pack information and facilitate internal processing. [00:13:00] The intrinsic interface (communication with yourself) is deemed the most important because your experience of external communication is always filtered through your personal context and bias. [00:15:25] The primary goal is not just to communicate better with others, but to get good at language to think better and communicate better with yourself. [00:16:02] Actively engineering your inner interface through increased awareness of surroundings and inner dialogue is suggested. Practical Methods for Developing Language Skills # [00:17:46] Reading works by \u0026ldquo;better thinkers\u0026rdquo; (like philosophers) is recommended. [00:18:17] Writing is highlighted as a particularly powerful tool for thinking better, as it externalizes context, allows revisiting, and helps dissect thoughts. [00:19:58] The difference between writing (allowing dissection/overthinking) and natural communication like speech (requiring flow) is noted, suggesting a balance is needed. [00:20:27] Video essays are discussed as a medium allowing experimentation with constraints on creation and interpretation time compared to writing. Conclusion: Mind Your Language for Self-Awareness # [00:21:29] Key takeaways include observing different forms of language, being aware of them, naming abstractions to build higher mental constructs, and consciously engaging with your own internal interpretations. [00:22:35] The phrase \u0026ldquo;mind your language\u0026rdquo; is reinterpreted as becoming more aware of and dissecting your own internal language and interpretation processes. [00:23:03] Communicating better with yourself is presented as essential for unbiased, objective self-understanding, which in turn improves communication with others.

They immediately note a recurring pattern in generating ideas by pivoting between opposing perspectives like \u0026ldquo;engineering others\u0026rsquo; perceptions\u0026rdquo; versus \u0026ldquo;engineering your own perception.\u0026rdquo; [00:01:50] This pattern of considering the internal vs. the external fundamentally changes the approach to abstract ideas. [00:05:20] Mid-thought, the host observes the spontaneity of changing the topic entirely and decides to pivot the discussion to \u0026ldquo;What is true serendipity?\u0026rdquo;. They suggest this act of changing topics spontaneously might be true serendipity. Exploring True Serendipity # [00:08:25] Questions arise about whether planned, lengthy rambles on a single topic constitute serendipity and why they enjoy serendipity. They link it to intellectual \u0026ldquo;ureka\u0026rdquo; moments. [00:11:05] The difficulty of benchmarking serendipity (similar to wisdom) is discussed, bringing up the concept of offering \u0026ldquo;Serendipity As A Service\u0026rdquo; and the challenge of Quality of Service (QoS) assurance. [00:13:10] The host describes ways one might feign or engineer serendipity, such as observing abstract patterns (like the internal/external focus) or making connections between disparate domains. [00:15:25] Another method is asking difficult questions to oneself, even if the answer isn\u0026rsquo;t known immediately, and exploring those questions in different directions. Engineering and Measuring Serendipity # [00:17:18] The idea of a metaphorical \u0026ldquo;serendipity switch\u0026rdquo; is proposed to indicate whether the host is relying on old thoughts or generating new ones in the moment. [00:19:42] The host outlines cognitive \u0026ldquo;tooling\u0026rdquo; used for expanding on ideas: Zooming in (specializing, details) Zooming out (abstract patterns) Linking/Connecting domains (evaluation/application) Courage (not worrying about sounding foolish) [00:21:40] Key Realization: A sixth tool for inducing serendipity is identified: forcing yourself to continue when you\u0026rsquo;ve run out of known points (enlisting everything and running to the end). The scarcity of known ideas in the moment forces present, serendipitous thought. [00:24:00] Another pattern observed is learning vs. realizing; they note how reframing past actions can lead to the realization that serendipity was being implicitly engineered all along. [00:27:30] The complex problem of ensuring the quality of serendipity (\u0026ldquo;How do you know I\u0026rsquo;m not fooling you?\u0026rdquo;) is explored. Who is the ultimate judge - the speaker or the audience? Measuring serendipity for groups of people is considered, possibly through feedback mechanisms like voting. Past Methods and Future Plans # [00:31:00] The host recalls a past method for explicitly engineering serendipity: writing down spontaneous ideas on crumpled notes, putting them in a box, and picking one at random to ramble about for a video. [00:34:40] They announce plans to return to this crumpled note method for upcoming SaaS videos, aiming for \u0026ldquo;next level extreme poor stuff\u0026rdquo; in terms of planning but potentially higher serendipity. [00:36:00] The importance of pacing for long-term optimization is mentioned as another concept for future exploration (serendipity switch off). [00:37:30] They describe the overall aim of engineering the ramble and documenting patterns found in a cryptograph (a knowledge graph) on their GitHub. [00:40:00] A brief mention of a partner, \u0026ldquo;The Bitmage,\u0026rdquo; who focuses on the technical \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; side, complementing the host\u0026rsquo;s more philosophical \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; approach. Conclusion # [00:38:50] The host reflects on the video as breaking some walls, having changed the topic mid-way and wrestling with difficult questions about the genuine nature and quality assurance of true serendipity. They acknowledge the challenge but express excitement for the process. The return to the crumpled note method is presented as a concrete way to actively engineer future serendipitous content.

The speaker shares their personal perspective on balancing exploitation and exploration, and the value of having a compass rather than a map in guiding one\u0026rsquo;s journey.\nThe Dilemma of Exploration vs. Exploitation # [00:00:00] The speaker introduces the concept of choosing between familiar, well-trodden paths and unexplored, unconventional ones. They highlight the value of documenting uncharted paths, making them more valuable due to their scarcity.\nUnderstanding the Balance Between Exploration and Exploitation # [00:02:00] The discussion revolves around the intrinsic idea of exploitation and the need to understand one\u0026rsquo;s unfair advantages. The speaker emphasizes that true knowledge of one\u0026rsquo;s advantages can only be achieved by exploring various possibilities.\nReversibility of Choices and Intrinsic Motivation # [00:03:00] The speaker touches on the reversibility of most life choices, suggesting that being aware and aligned with one\u0026rsquo;s desires makes it possible to trace back or adjust one\u0026rsquo;s path. They question whether life should be driven by opportunism or intrinsic motivation.\nThe Importance of Exploration # [00:05:00] Exploration is presented as a core value for a fulfilling life. Setting goals based on current knowledge may limit one\u0026rsquo;s potential, as future discoveries can redefine objectives. The speaker advocates for disciplined curiosity and balancing exploration with exploitation.\nRethinking Objectives and Embracing the Unknown # [00:07:00] The speaker suggests challenging assumptions behind one\u0026rsquo;s objectives and purposes. Having a clear goal can hinder the ability to choose unconventional paths. They propose relaxing constraints on destinies and objectives to enjoy the journey.\nNavigating Life with a Compass Rather Than a Map # [00:10:00] Using the analogy of navigating to the North Pole with a compass, the speaker illustrates that having a general direction is sometimes more effective than following a precise map. They encourage a more holistic and principle-oriented approach to life.\nCalculated Risks and the Joy of the Journey # [00:15:00] The importance of taking measured and calculated risks early in life is emphasized. The speaker shares their personal experience with curiosity-driven endeavors, highlighting the potential for both significant gains and losses.\nBalancing Mission-Oriented and Principle-Oriented Goals # [00:20:00] The speaker concludes by suggesting a balance between having clear, mission-oriented goals and broader, principle-oriented guidelines. They advocate for occasionally ditching detailed plans and finding one\u0026rsquo;s own path, emphasizing discipline, curiosity, and calculated risk-taking.\nConclusion # [00:25:00] The video ends with the speaker encouraging viewers to explore unconventional paths, question conventional advice, and embrace the journey with a mix of direction and openness to experience.

[00:00:42] Proper formulation is key, stressing the importance of understanding the vocabulary and jargon of the problem\u0026rsquo;s domain, which in computer science is referred to as a Domain Specific Language (DSL). [00:01:32] Building languages (DSLs) to solve problems is presented as a powerful viewpoint, applicable across various domains. The power lies in representing states, behaviors, and transformations as symbols and using higher abstractions. [00:02:15] Using the example of making coffee, the speaker illustrates the ambiguity of natural language (\u0026ldquo;making a cup of coffee\u0026rdquo;) compared to the necessary precision needed for a machine to solve the problem (\u0026ldquo;a cup with some coffee in it\u0026rdquo;). [00:03:24] Formulating a problem requires defining base abstractions and available resources (e.g., microwave, water, instant coffee, cup). [00:04:14] Solving a specific kind of problem repeatedly benefits from facilitating the application of a domain (a DSL) rather than just a specific solution. The Power and Structure of DSLs # [00:04:45] A convex optimizer library is given as an example of a DSL, where the vocabulary is based on math (matrix algebra, calculus) allowing users to work with high-level concepts like matrices, constraints, and gradients instead of low-level machine details. [00:05:45] Using any higher-level programming language is a step towards building a base language/jargon (DSL) for effectively solving problems and expressing classes of solutions. [00:06:20] The elaborateness (richness of base abstractions), power, expressiveness, and encapsulation of a DSL determine the intricacy and value of the solutions it can express. This is why DSLs are crucial for efficiency and reusability. [00:07:49] The concept of a meta-DSL or a generic problem solver is discussed, exploring the idea of giving a solver access to base abstractions and an oracle to determine if the problem is solved, allowing it to explore solutions. Natural Language vs. DSLs and Modern Takes # [00:10:02] Natural language is deemed too vague for precise problem formulation, leading to interpretation issues and the need for iterating on implicit assumptions. While convenient for quick fixes, it\u0026rsquo;s inefficient for problems encountered repeatedly. [00:11:48] Building DSLs is presented as the most efficient long-term approach to problem-solving, allowing users to solve problems faster over time and improve the DSL itself. [00:12:26] Natural language forces users to adopt unclear assumptions. The speaker contrasts using natural language (\u0026ldquo;cut twice and never measure\u0026rdquo;) with building DSLs (\u0026ldquo;measure twice\u0026hellip; cut once\u0026rdquo;). [00:13:30] Modern approaches like LLMs can delegate the implicit conversion of natural language to base assumptions and procedures by training on vast datasets, but this relies on statistical probability rather than true understanding. [00:15:03] The speaker questions the continued heavy reliance on natural language in engineering domains where powerful abstractions (math, physics, computing) already exist. Natural language is more helpful in vague domains or pseudosciences. Conclusion and Recommendation # [00:17:05] To truly understand and solve problems effectively, particularly in engineering, it is best to understand the DSL of the domain – its vocabulary and jargon. [00:19:20] Diving into the DSL of a domain helps comprehend and express concepts better. Language is powerful, and understanding its structure allows expressing behaviors, attributes, and transformations formally using symbols (hinting at concepts like symbolic computation and lambda calculus). [00:20:54] The main takeaway is to not limit oneself to natural language, but to put effort into understanding and building DSLs for better problem comprehension and efficient, long-term solutions.

They use a \u0026ldquo;thunk\u0026rdquo; system to offload thoughts to a future point in time, helping to avoid mental overload. The concept of a \u0026ldquo;thunk\u0026rdquo; is drawn from programming, representing a deferred computation with its context. The Challenge of Overthinking # [00:05:00] The speaker discusses how overthinking can make life monotonous and reduce the likelihood of being surprised.\nOverthinking can lead to a decrease in surprises due to pre-emptively considering various scenarios. The speaker explores the idea of \u0026ldquo;guard railing\u0026rdquo; parts of their brain to prevent overthinking in certain contexts. Strategies for Managing Overthinking # [00:10:00] The speaker shares personal strategies for managing overthinking, including capturing thoughts and delaying their processing.\nCapturing Thunks: The speaker has developed a system to capture thunks (thoughts to be processed later) and garbage collect them weekly. Delaying Computation: Delaying the processing of thunks until a later time helps in managing overthinking. Physical Activity and Sensory Input: Engaging in physical activities and experiencing vivid sensory inputs help calm the mind. Accepting Overthinking # [00:20:00] The speaker emphasizes the importance of accepting one\u0026rsquo;s tendency to overthink as a norm.\nAccepting overthinking as a normal state can help reduce cognitive tension and stress. The act of accepting this tendency itself requires reasoning and skepticism. Conclusion and Call to Action # [00:30:00] The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to observe their thought patterns neutrally rather than self-diagnosing.\nThe speaker suggests that overthinking is not necessarily a problem but rather a characteristic that can be harnessed properly. Viewers are encouraged to subscribe to the channel for more philosophical and cognitive explorations. Final Thoughts # [00:35:00] The speaker reflects on their experimental approach to understanding their mind and thoughts, inviting viewers to join them on this journey.\nThe speaker promises \u0026ldquo;offbeat thoughts\u0026rdquo; and an experimental approach to cognitive aspects of life. There\u0026rsquo;s an invitation to explore the potential of overengineering cognitive infrastructure.

It encourages a shift from passive user to an active architect of one\u0026rsquo;s digital environment and mind.\nExpanding Personal Computing: Beyond Devices # [00:00:48] The idea of personal computing goes beyond just devices like laptops and phones to encompass an entire ecosystem, including wearable tech, the cloud (data centers), and interconnected systems. [00:02:15] Modern personal computing, from an engineering perspective, emphasizes knowing your infrastructure, using open source tools, self-hosting services, and achieving personal data sovereignty – being in control of your data whereabouts and usage. [00:03:00] Self-hosting and managing your own infrastructure (home labs, VPS) is a move towards being an evolved user, rather than just a convenient one. Building Your Own Systems and Automation # [00:03:31] The next stage involves building your own compute, \u0026ldquo;knowledge systems,\u0026rdquo; and pipelines. This includes automation tooling, writing custom scripts (e.g., Python), and using connectors (like Zapier) to integrate different services and tools. [00:04:47] The goal is to create an unstructured way of dealing with your own mind to give it structure, extending capabilities beyond physical tools and inherent cognitive limits. Cognitive Infrastructure and Indexing # [00:05:10] A common approach to extending cognitive capabilities is using a \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo; or digital zettelkasten, organizing notes and ideas. Different mindsets (gardener, surgeon, bonsai) can be applied to managing this system. [00:06:00] Deeper engineering perspective involves generic thinking about compute, networking, storage, and interfaces, leading to efficiency improvements (touch typing, speed reading) and alternative interaction methods (voice control, eye tracking). [00:07:48] A key psychological shift is building a \u0026ldquo;scaffolding\u0026rdquo; of compute, networking, and storage around your thoughts and mind. [00:08:15] A personal project example: Indexing chaotic creative content (logs, journals, videos) to make it searchable and useful. Linear search is difficult for large amounts of personal data. [00:09:00] The idea of a personal data lake allows for indexing, similar to how photos can be indexed by captions. [00:10:09] Text is highlighted as a unifying theme across different data types (voice, video, images can be converted to text) due to its symbolic nature and efficiency in conveying information quickly through shared context. Symbols are considered primal and natural to thought. Personal Computing as Engineering Your Mind # [00:15:54] Personal computing, in this advanced sense, is about engineering cognitive infrastructure to better understand and extend your own mind, rather than just performing external tasks or storing knowledge. [00:16:27] Indexing is a vital start for interacting with personal information quickly. [00:16:53] Building this infrastructure yourself (self-hosting) allows understanding what\u0026rsquo;s happening underneath (e.g., building a RAG store or vector index for your thoughts). [00:17:31] Modeling your own mind in terms of data sources, sinks, and behaviors to offload functions to a computer. An example is indexing personal video transcripts by creating metadata (tags, summaries) and storing it in a database. [00:18:56] Having such a personal data index helps in quick retrieval and understanding the evolution of your own thoughts over time, placing you beyond the limitations of relying solely on present memory. The Final Stage: The World as a Computer # [00:20:12] The final stage is seeing everything as programs, not just physical devices. Inputs, processors, outputs, and feedback loops are everywhere, even subtle transformations like sunlight and felt warmth. [00:21:18] This involves seeing the world through the lens of systems thinking, probabilistic computing, chaos theory, and physics. [00:21:50] The core idea is understanding the world as transformations or functions, similar to the Matrix concept. [00:22:15] To truly grasp this, one must delve into symbolic algebra, symbolic computing, or semiotics. Symbols, including transformations, are first-class citizens in this view, enabling powerful interpretations of the world and potentially recursive understanding (transforming transformations). [00:24:37] This view, influenced by fields like Lisp and symbolic computation, is a powerful framework for interpreting the world, moving from discrete devices to a comprehensive view of reality as a computational or symbolic system. Conclusion # [00:25:22] The video concludes by stating that personal computing, at its deepest level, is about applying abstract computational and symbolic domains to understand oneself and the world. This high-level understanding of technical concepts may become increasingly necessary for better human cognition and living.\n","date":"13 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/saas/personal-computing/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eArchitecting your Matrix..\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eSaaS: 0x5 \n    \u003cdiv id=\"saas-0x5\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#saas-0x5\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n      \u003ciframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" loading=\"eager\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/glaLqyIA0j0?autoplay=0\u0026amp;controls=1\u0026amp;end=0\u0026amp;loop=0\u0026amp;mute=0\u0026amp;start=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"YouTube video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eOverview \n    \u003cdiv id=\"overview\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#overview\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis video discusses expanding the concept of \u003cstrong\u003e\u0026ldquo;personal computing\u0026rdquo;\u003c/strong\u003e beyond traditional hardware devices to encompass a broader ecosystem, data sovereignty, automation, and ultimately seeing the world and one\u0026rsquo;s own cognitive processes through the lens of symbolic computation and transformations.

It examines how organizations and individuals navigate operational inertia, when to hedge bets, and the role of “abstraction travelers” who bridge fundamental thought and practical application.\n[00:00:00] Introduction # Welcome to SaaS X4: topic is the nature of adaptation vs retrofitting. Retrofitting: forcing new inventions into old systems without rethinking optimal use. Optimal adaptation: redesigning systems to fully leverage new ideas for long-term benefits. [00:01:00] Defining Retrofitting vs Optimal Adaptation # Retrofitting often yields minor improvements but under-utilizes novel concepts. Optimal adaptation may carry higher risk but offers maximal performance gains. [00:02:15] Research ↔ Industry Lag # Academia generates ambitious findings; mainstream application lags behind. Practical constraints in industry lead to incremental updates rather than bold redesigns. [00:04:00] Operational Inertia \u0026amp; Organizational Scale # Operational inertia: heavy legacy infrastructures slow large entities. Startups enjoy agility, whereas big tech has scale-advantages but struggles to pivot. [00:07:30] Strategic Trade-offs: Adapt vs Retrofit # Two choices when a new finding emerges: Prioritize existing system (retrofit). Prioritize the new principle (adapt). Horses vs cars analogy: sticking with stables vs building fuel stations illustrates tipping points. [00:12:00] Personal Scale: Software Engineering \u0026amp; AI # Modern devs use Co-Pilots, LLMs, CI/CD pipelines—trajectories differ from past masters. New learners face a communication gap: tools and problems evolve faster than craft traditions. [00:17:30] Hedging Bets \u0026amp; Fundamental Focus # Large organizations can run parallel modes; individuals must hedge carefully. Deep/fundamental knowledge reduces churn: Fundamental operations → fewer superficial adaptations. Shallow abstractions → constant re-learning as tools evolve. [00:22:00] Role of Abstraction Travelers # These specialists shuttle between core theory and real-world implementation. They: Seed new ideas, Prototype \u0026amp; iterate, Communicate execution details to practitioners. [00:25:30] Historical Case: Nikola Tesla # Tesla exemplifies abstraction traveling: Understood electromagnetic fundamentals, Engineered AC dynamos, Bridged theory ↔ mass-market application. [00:28:30] Conclusion \u0026amp; Call to Action # Main message: Balance retrofitting with optimal adaptation by Recognizing operational inertia, Focusing on fundamentals, Cultivating “abstraction traveler” skills.

He highlights that logging involves creating a record of events or thoughts over time.\n[00:02:00] The Effort and Benefits of Logging # Logging requires more effort than simply doing things without recording them, according to Raj. The primary benefit of logging is the ability to \u0026ldquo;time travel\u0026rdquo; and recall past events, thoughts, or experiences, as noted by him. Logging helps in creating a dense index of memories, making it easier to recall specific details, Raj explains. [00:05:00] Personal Experience with Logging # Raj shares his personal experience of starting to write publicly at the age of 18 and how it has helped him in recalling past experiences and thoughts.\n[00:08:00] The Value of Logging in Cognitive Processes # Logging aids in thinking in a more absolute manner by providing a broader perspective on time, Raj observes. It helps in understanding patterns and changes over time by analyzing behavior over a collection of instances, he adds. [00:12:00] The Alternative to Logging # Not logging leads to running in cognitive circles, repeating similar experiences without significant progress, Raj suggests. The mind interprets experiences by taking a weighted average, with recent events and significant experiences (like trauma or pleasure) being given more weight, he notes. [00:17:00] The Importance of Logging for Reflection and Growth # Logging helps in anchoring thoughts and building structures around past experiences, according to Raj. It is particularly valuable during moments of reflection, such as during dawn or while doing relaxing activities, he points out. [00:22:00] Logging and Version Control # Raj discusses the importance of version control as a form of logging, which helps in tracking changes and differences over time. He highlights its application not just in coding but potentially in any aspect of life.\n[00:25:00] Conclusion on the Benefits of Logging # Logging forms the \u0026ldquo;currency\u0026rdquo; to cognitive infrastructure, enabling thoughts to flow between different mental circuits, Raj explains. It is a maintenance work that pays off over time by building a resilient circuit for cognition, he concludes. [00:27:00] Final Remarks # Raj concludes by emphasizing that logging is a valuable practice that enhances cognitive abilities and personal growth. He invites viewers to check out his other channel, \u0026ldquo;The Bit Mage,\u0026rdquo; for more technical content.\nKey Takeaways:\nLogging enhances memory and recall by creating a dense index of past experiences and thoughts. It aids in personal growth and reflection by providing a broader perspective on time and helping to understand patterns and changes. Version control is a powerful form of logging that can be applied to various aspects of life, not just coding. The video emphasizes the importance of adopting logging practices to improve cognitive functions and overall personal development.\n","date":"7 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/saas/on-logging/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn establishing the rhythmic current to your cognitive circuitry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch1 class=\"relative group\"\u003eSaaS 0x2 \n    \u003cdiv id=\"saas-0x2\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#saas-0x2\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n      \u003ciframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" loading=\"eager\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7NCAg-0i0E?autoplay=0\u0026amp;controls=1\u0026amp;end=0\u0026amp;loop=0\u0026amp;mute=0\u0026amp;start=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"YouTube video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eThe Importance of Logging and Its Benefits \n    \u003cdiv id=\"the-importance-of-logging-and-its-benefits\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#the-importance-of-logging-and-its-benefits\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe video discusses the significance of logging, whether it be through journaling, blogging, or version control, and its role in enhancing cognitive abilities and personal growth.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"On Logging","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"7 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/recall/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Recall","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/reflect/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Reflect","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/version/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Version","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/write/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Write","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cartography/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cartography","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cognitive-infrastructure/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cognitive Infrastructure","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/complexity/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Complexity","type":"tags"},{"content":"On the urge to grasp \u0026ldquo;the act of grasping\u0026rdquo; itself..\nSaaS: 0x1 # Overview # The video discusses the concept of epistemological cartography, which involves mapping out knowledge and understanding its structure.
