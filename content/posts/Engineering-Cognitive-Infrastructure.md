UPDATE : [ 0x24A1|1767393947 ] :  this is a one-man-army kinda situation and I use "We" to sound dramatic (I don't possess any rings) : I'm just trying to have fun and battle boredom

CognWare Industries was established on May 1st, 2025: dedicated to engineering cognitive infrastructure - personal to planetary.  

The bridge between cognition and computing has been, is, and will remain dense, laden with insights for societal evolution.  

Much remains unthought, unexplored, unnamed..  
 
We solve problems, document them, think rigorously, and ask the questions that reveal what lies ahead: for the best of humanity to focus on. It’s not just about avoiding the reinvention of wheels, it's about accelerating our grasp of symbolic wheels yet to come.  

Our technological and cognitive evolution rates are symbiotic catalysts, and mutual bottlenecks.  

Epistemological cartography across meta-domains is our explicit mission.
