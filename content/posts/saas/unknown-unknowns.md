### Understanding Unknown Unknowns

{{< youtube IIJOfI5G0Hw >}}

This video discusses the concept of "unknown unknowns" – limitations you don't know you have or challenges you can't foresee – and offers strategies for dealing with them effectively in life and work.


 -   [00:00] The concept of unknown unknowns is introduced, often learned early in life through ambitious projects where unforeseen problems arise.
 -   [01:10] Being aware of unknown unknowns is a **powerful cognitive tool** for better planning, timelines, risk assessment, and structuring efforts, recognizing that not everything can be fully modeled or predicted.

### Strategies for Dealing with Uncertainty
 -   [01:58] **Preparation and Contingency:** While impossible to have a plan for *everything* (like Batman), having generic contingency plans and reactions is useful.
 -   [03:00] **Categorization and Triage:** Triage potential issues into categories and engineer generic responses based on these classifications (like handling different hurricane categories).
 -   [04:10] **Exploration and Sidecar Projects:** Dedicate time to exploration or have `sidecar projects` that are exploratory in nature within your domain. This includes browsing new research, reading, and identifying potential novel impacts on your current work.
 -   [06:20] Understanding uncertainty and unknown unknowns encourages a **more peaceful life** and helps handle unexpected setbacks or being "derailed" better.
 -   [07:05] While the future can't be predicted precisely, you can understand its generic probabilistic distribution and focus on picking up the signal rather than the noise.

### Building Cognitive Infrastructure
 -   [08:30] **Naming Abstractions:** Create a language or terminology around unknown unknowns to help categorize them and develop frameworks for dealing with them in the moment.
 -   [09:50] **Engineering Your Psyche:** Develop a generic, extractable cognitive infrastructure – a flexible set of tools and tactics applicable in various situations.

### The Power of Stories and Shared Context
 -   [10:40] **Using Analogies from Fiction:** Leverage fictional universes (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings), video games, or stories (movies, books) to create analogies and categorize unknown unknowns when they arise.
 -   [18:00] Stories serve as a `super dense encoding` for conveying strategies, states of mind, and context quickly and enjoyably to others.
 -   [21:55] **Shared Story Consumption:** If working in a team or organization, sharing common stories creates a mutual language or `symbolic index` for rapid communication and synchronization of strategies when encountering new issues.
 -   [24:30] Music and other cultural elements (concerts, movies) also act as forms of dense encoding, helping to align or `synchronize` collective human minds towards ideas or moods.
 -   [28:00] This shared context allows you to trigger specific associations or strategies in others rapidly, effectively orchestrating the "global cognitive infrastructure" with simple references.

### The Final Strategy: Humility and Experience
 -   [30:40] **Know Your Limit:** Don't overestimate what you can realistically do. Ambitious failures teach humility and the limits of prediction.
 -   [32:10] **Value Experience:** Gain experience and learn intuitively from failures. Some necessary skills for dealing with unknown unknowns are not fully conveyable through theory but are learned through practice and failure.
 -   [33:40] **Build Better Languages (Jargon):** Continue to build and refine your personal language or use jargon to quickly encode and convey complex concepts or experiences.
