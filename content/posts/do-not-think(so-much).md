I've been thinking a lot lately about how much I think.  

Premature optimization is the terminology one could leverage to better represent what I've been dealing with lately..  

structuring how I write, the way I use words, what thumbnail do I use, what topic is great for the moment, is that framing right, should I even be talking about this topic, am I being too raw, what's my quality assurance process, should these concatenated phrases make sense or people would just get it?  

all that and a whole lot more  

I started writing so that I could delegate the burden of my thoughts onto the world: I've lately, reclaimed that burden and it doesn't quite feel right: proceeding to move fast and break things.  

*5 mins later*  

was distracted and lost my train of thought: that is a great thing.  

usually I would cook something to make this post sound (/read) dramatic and complete but don't care now.
