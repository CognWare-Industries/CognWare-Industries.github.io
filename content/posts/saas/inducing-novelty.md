### Understanding Novelty
[00:00:00] Raj starts by explaining that novelty is subjective and can vary from person to person. He discusses how people can experience novelty by changing their perspective or acting as if they don't know something.

### Methods to Induce Novelty
[00:05:00] Raj shares several methods to induce novelty:

### Handling Paradoxes and Multiple Realities
[00:15:00] Raj discusses the importance of being able to handle paradoxes and multiple realities. He explains that being open to different perspectives and not being tied to a single "truth" can help induce novelty.
