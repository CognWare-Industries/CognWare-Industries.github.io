This video explores the concept of framing a **general analysis framework** as a precursor to building a general problem solver. The speaker discusses the thought process behind creating a transferable toolkit for understanding and diagnosing various abstract problems, independent of specific domain objectives.

### The Need for General Analysis

 - [00:00:45] The speaker introduces **general analysis** as a generic, diagnostic toolkit applicable to many abstractions.

 - [00:02:00] Analysis should facilitate critical thought and provide directives for exploring potential solutions by symbolically analyzing concepts.

### Framing the Analysis: Foundations

 - [00:02:50] A key starting point is defining a **domain-specific language (DSL)** and choosing appropriate *axioms* or fundamental units for the problem.
 - [00:03:30] Selecting a sensible level of *granularity* or the "basement level" of abstraction is crucial. Being aware of your own context-based axioms is helpful.
 - [00:04:10] Building upon this foundation involves laying generic foundations for analysis.

### Dimensions and State Analysis

 - [00:04:50] The framework involves identifying **orthogonal axes or dimensions** of analysis.
 - [00:05:10] Across variations of these dimensions, one analyzes the **context** or **state** of the problem.
 - [00:05:58] Example dimension: **Time** (analyzing context in past, present, future predictions; can be continuous or discrete milestones).
 - [00:06:20] Example dimension: **Scale** or **Size** (how context varies with scale; defining parameters for scale involves parameter engineering).
 - [00:07:10] Dimensions can involve **discrete categories** or **continuous variations**.
 - [00:08:10] Engineering proper units or indicators is referred to as *parameter engineering* or *representation learning*.

### Abstract Spaces and Combining Dimensions

 - [00:09:15] Analysis can focus on individual dimensions or **combinations** (e.g., how scale changes over time).
 - [00:10:05] The state or context can be modeled as a function of input parameters (a tuple combining metrics from axes), existing in an **abstract space** rather than a simple geometric one.
 - [00:11:30] The state should ideally be represented flexibly, not bound to simple scalar or vector fields for general analysis.
 - [00:12:00] The speaker proposes the term **semiotensoric space** to describe a combination of symbols (categorical) and tensors (numerical/vectoric) for representing both inputs (axes) and outputs (state).
 - [00:12:30] The analysis itself can be viewed as **transformations between semiotensoric spaces**, mapping input dimensions to the resulting state representation.

### Applying Calculus and Gradients

 - [00:13:00] Within this abstract framework, calculus concepts like **partial derivatives** or **gradients** can potentially be applied to analyze rates of change of the state with respect to specific dimensions (particularly the tensoric parts).
 - [00:14:00] While standard gradients (nabla) on the entire semiotensoric state might not be feasible, partial optimization of specific components is conceivable.

### Conclusion: The Generic Analyzer

 - [00:15:00] The overarching idea is to develop a **generic analysis framework** that can be applied to any domain without starting from scratch.
 - [00:15:15] Such a framework could auto-generate a DSL, analyze problems in the semiotensoric space, and produce reports.
 - [00:16:00] This SaaS video outlines the *what* and *why* of this general analysis idea, while the speaker's other content (The Bit Mage channel) explores the *how* (the technical math and programming).

The video concludes by emphasizing that these are initial thoughts towards building a powerful, transferable tool for understanding complex problems.
